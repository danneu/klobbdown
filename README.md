# klobbdown

A Markdown implementation for my `klobb` static site generator.

* The grammar is here: https://github.com/danneu/klobbdown/blob/master/src/klobbdown/parse.clj

It's an autodidactic pursuit.

## Why?

I didn't see a Clojure Markdown implementation that expressed a grammar and found them hard to understand.

I'd like klobbdown to become a feature complete Markdown implementation with better defaults than Markdown proper so that I can use it for my blog.

## Using Instaparse

I use the incredible [Engelberg/instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) Clojure library to express my grammar.

Instaparse is the library that convinced me that I could do this.
